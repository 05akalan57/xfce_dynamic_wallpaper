# Description
* This application changes the background image according to the time for xfce desktop environments.

# Note
* Changing the system clock manually does not trigger a background change.
* You can replace the pictures in the "src/backgrounds" folder with your own images and reload them. (Without changing the names!)
* The names of the images in the "src/backgrounds" folder represent the hours (Example: 6.jpg ------ 06:00)
